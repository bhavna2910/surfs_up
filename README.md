# surfs_up Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of our analysis is to review temperature statistics and other weather patterns in Hawaii to help make a decision if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. Per the ask, it involved focussing on the temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two periods to help assess whether this initiative would make profits or not.

## Results
These two dataframes for June and December tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. 

### Some takeaways:
* Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature difference and thus there is a **very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.**
* The **maximum temperatures** limit for the month of June is 85 degree and for December, it is and 83 degree which **are also remarkable similar.**
* **The minimum temperature** of 56 (December) and 64 (June) **show the greatest variance**, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to operate an ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December), a little more variation in the December numbers can be expected.

## Summary
Overall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low below June temperature.
1. Additional queries that could be run include **Precipation difference** between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather.
2. A comaparison by **weather station** could also be helpful, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. 
3. Weather station with **close proximity to prospective location** could also be considered, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for analysis.
